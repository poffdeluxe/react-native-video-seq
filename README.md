# react-native-video-seq
A wrapper for [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video) that supports playing a sequence of videos.

I wrote this component for a personal project and I figured I'd share it with the world.

## Install
1. `npm i -S react-native-video-seq` or `yarn add react-native-video-seq`
2. `react-native link`
3. You should be good to go

## Examples
Check out the [example project](https://github.com/poffdeluxe/react-native-video-seq/tree/master/example)

## TODO
1. TESTS
2. Not sure yet
